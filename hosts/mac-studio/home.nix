# mac-studio Home Configuration
#
# User environment for the mac-studio host. Shared home config (monitoring, zsh
# keychain/token init, copyApps, MLX, OrbStack wiring) lives in ../common/home.nix.
# Headless server: no host-specific GUI app list — `home-profile.preset = server`
# (from the registry class) already drops the GUI/desktop features.
