# Claude Code auto-mode trusted-infrastructure context.
#
# Imported by programs.claude.settings.autoMode.environment in home.nix
# and read by Claude's auto-mode classifier as prose rules. Without
# these, the classifier blocks routine cross-repo, cross-org, cloud,
# and homelab operations as potential exfiltration. Reference:
# https://code.claude.com/docs/en/auto-mode-config.
#
# Source-of-truth context lives at https://docs.jacobpevans.com
# (source: github.com/JacobPEvans/docs). Update entries here when the
# trusted infrastructure footprint changes.
#
# Sources the GitHub username from userConfig.user.fullName so the
# value stays consistent with lib/user-config.nix. The secondary
# `dryvist` org is hardcoded — it's a separate GitHub organization,
# not part of the user's primary identity, so not modeled in userConfig.

  "Single-developer personal homelab plus day-job (Splunk/Cribl architect). Public docs map: https://${docsHost} (source github.com/${ghUser}/docs) covers Infrastructure, Nix ecosystem, AI development, Observability, Security, and Tools surfaces."
  "Source control: GitHub orgs github.com/${ghUser}/* and github.com/dryvist/*. All public repos under both are trusted to clone, push, branch, and PR-mutate against. Force-push to feature branches is routine; force-push to main is off-limits."
  "Workspace layout: ~/git/<repo>/main is the main-branch worktree. Feature work happens in ~/git/<repo>/<type>/<name>/ via git worktrees. Standard across every repo."
  "Cloud: AWS via aws-vault profiles (terraform-aws, terraform-aws-bedrock); Proxmox cluster on the home LAN (terraform-proxmox plus ansible-proxmox-*). No multi-tenant production."
  "Secrets stores: Doppler (ai-ci-automation/prd project carries AI/MCP keys); macOS Keychain (ai-secrets keychain holds ANTHROPIC_API_KEY etc.; elevate-access keychain holds elevated GH tokens via the RESTRICTED/PRIVATE/ADMIN tier system); Mozilla SOPS handles at-rest encryption; Bitwarden vault plus Bitwarden Secrets Manager. No long-lived AWS keys — OIDC handles CI."
  "AI runtimes: local MLX server on this Mac (mlx-server devenv shell); Claude / Codex / Gemini / Copilot CLIs all routed through local dev shells; PAL MCP proxy handles multi-model orchestration; HuggingFace CLI handles model management."
  "Observability stack: OpenTelemetry instrumentation → Cribl Stream → Splunk Enterprise (homelab). splunk-dev devenv shell on local Splunk work."
  "Self-hosted runners: GitHub Actions self-hosted RunsOn runners labeled per the ${ghUser}/.github v3 catalog. Jobs targeting RunsOn labels are routine."
  "Container deployment: LXC on Proxmox is the default in production homelab workloads. Docker only on vendor-locked images that require it (high-throughput network traffic must never flow through Docker's virtualized networking)."
  "Nix-first: nix-darwin (macOS), nix-home (cross-platform user env), nix-ai (AI tooling), nix-devenv (reusable dev shells plus flakeModules.dev-hygiene), nix-claude-code (Claude Code declarative module). Flakes-only — never use nix-env."
  "Pre-commit, linting, format: pre-commit hooks come from nix-devenv.flakeModules.dev-hygiene in Nix repos. zizmor policy from dryvist/.github (trusted publishers: actions/*, DeterminateSystems/*, googleapis/* may use ref-pins; everything else requires hash-pins)."
